This week, we will learn some of the technical details of how to create charts to **compare values** to one another and to a benchmark. Most of these articles have code in them that illustrate how to create each chart type, and I encourage you to try and reproduce the examples provided in R yourself. In addition to these articles, another particularly useful site to review is the [top 50 ggplots](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html), which contains examples with ggplot code to create 50 common visualizations.

Plot types for comparing values:

- [Bars](http://uc-r.github.io/barcharts)
- [Lollipops](https://uc-r.github.io/lollipop)
- [Dots](http://uc-r.github.io/cleveland-dot-plots)
- [Slopes](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html#Slope%20Chart)
- [Bullets](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2017/5/25/the-bullet-graph)
- [Ridgelines](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/boxplots-violins.html#boxplots-violins-horizontal)
