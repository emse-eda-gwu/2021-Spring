# Task 1: Reflection

Put your reflection here


# Task 2: Interactive plots

```{r load-libraries-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

# Load data here
```

Do the following:

1. Make a plot. Any kind of plot will do (though it might be easiest to work with `geom_point()`).

2. Make the plot interactive with `ggplotly()`.

3. Make sure the hovering tooltip is more informative than the default.

Good luck and have fun!
