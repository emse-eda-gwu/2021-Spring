Students should have taken [Programming for Analytics](https://emse-p4a-gwu.github.io/) or have experience with at least one programming language. If you're not sure whether you have the necessary prerequisite skills, you can try and get up to speed by completing [Assignment 0](a0-course-prereqs.html) **before classes start**. Once classes start, it may be difficult to keep up without this background, and it may be more beneficial to wait and take this course next year after taking Programming for Analytics in the coming Fall.
