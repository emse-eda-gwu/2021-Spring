**You can use Slack to**:

- Ask general questions.
- Ask for help with an assignment.
- Send direct, private messages to each other or the instructors (just like email...but better!)

## RStudio in the browser!

If you're having trouble installing R or RStudio, don't worry - you can quickly launch a _virtual_ version of RStudio in your webbrowser! Click on the <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> logo in the menu bar and log in with your GWU web ID and password.

**Note**: You must be on the GW network for this to work. If you're off campus, you can get on the network remotely using a [VPN](https://seascf.seas.gwu.edu/vpn-access).

## The syllabus

Take a look at the [syllabus](syllabus.html). This is your contract for the course - review it to learn what will be expected of you throughout the semester and how you will be assessed. Pay attention to the homework assignments and due dates.

## The schedule

The course [schedule](schedule.html) is your road map for the semester. Visit it often to make sure you are well-prepared for class and aware of upcoming dates for assignments, quizzes, etc.

## Communication & Help

This can be a challenging class - don't suffer in silence! Look at the ["Getting Help"](ref-getting-help.html) page, come to office hours, send me a message on Slack.
