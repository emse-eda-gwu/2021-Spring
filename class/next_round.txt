3:
- Drop lotr_words from first main practice (just use milk data)
- Improve the last exercise of wildlife state vs operator

4:
- Entire linear modeling part is unnecessary - we won't use it in exploring data, and there are too many unaddressed questions (e.g. error). Instead, drop this whole section and fill it in with a detailed discussion on bias in data.
So first 2 classes on EDA are centrality, variability, and correlation + bias in data.

6:
- switch reading on "facets" to the next week (I moved it out of "amounts" and put in in "comparisons")
