3-centrality-variability:
- Drop lotr_words from first main practice (just use milk data)
- Improve the last exercise of wildlife state vs operator

4-correlation:
- Entire linear modeling part is unnecessary - we won't use it in exploring data, and there are too many unaddressed questions (e.g. error). Instead, drop this whole section and fill it in with a detailed discussion on bias in data.
So first 2 classes on EDA are centrality, variability, and correlation + bias in data.
- Add a discussion of log scales. Look at example of correlation between transit cost and length from mini project 1 last year. Many students said no correlation, but it's just because it's a log correlation.

6:
- switch reading on "facets" to the next week (I moved it out of "amounts" and put in in "comparisons")
- consider dropping waffles if geom_waffle() still not working...look carefully at install options, sometimes not on CRAN or github but elsewhere

8 - trends:
- Log scales - use them to show doubling rate? penny doubling example?
- Index chart (Financial times log chart of COVID cases - all start at days after 100 cases)
