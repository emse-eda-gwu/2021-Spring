General:
- Add a long list of packages to install at the start of class on the prep page for installing R - include devtools, then go through every package we have. Plus include XQuartz if you're a mac user.
- Add a link to an rstudio.seas.gwu.edu session for every class so students can immediately get back on track if they have install problems.
- Consider moving data cleaning up earlier.
- Add an intro to ggplot lecture earlier after fundamentals of EDA are done. Include "scales" from the polishing lesson + basic annotations + multi-panel plots. Then the "polish" lessons is mostly about colors & fonts + anything else. Other option: Break the polish lesson into 1) scales + colors, 2) annotations + fonts + maybe multi-panel plots and / or good examples of using a theme throughout the whole Rmd file - pick colors from the bootswatch theme?
- Add gif freeze on all slides
- move interview out of the "final project" in the menu and to a separate page

2- EDA:
- consider adding skim() from skimr package

3-centrality-variability:
- Drop lotr_words from first main practice (just use milk data)
- Improve the last exercise of wildlife state vs operator
- Better examples of variability in _categorical_ data (bars of counts)

4-correlation:
- Entire linear modeling part is unnecessary - we won't use it in exploring data, and there are too many unaddressed questions (e.g. uncertainty). Instead, drop this whole section and fill it in with a more detailed discussion on bias in data with more examples than the plane chart. So make the first 2 classes on EDA about 1) centrality & variability based on data types, and correlation + bias in data.
- Add a discussion of log scales. Look at example of correlation between transit cost and length from mini project 1 last year. Many students said no correlation, but it's just because it's a log correlation (these examples are in slides on polishing).

5 - visualizing information:
- Swap this one in somewhere badvis: https://twitter.com/CalEndow/status/1367973471523835904
- Consider actually including the wind graphic in here as an example, then they will have seen it before the MP2.

6 - Amounts and proportions:
- switch reading on "facets" to the next week (I moved it out of "amounts" and put in in "comparisons")
- consider dropping waffles if geom_waffle() still not working...look carefully at install options, sometimes not on CRAN or github but elsewhere.
- example to add to reading on waffles: https://policeviolencereport.org/

8 - trends:
- Log scales - use them to show doubling rate? penny doubling example?
- Index chart (Financial times log chart of COVID cases - all start at days after 100 cases)
- On animation, add new images on climate change: nyt_temp.mp4, nyt_temp.gif
  Source: https://www.nytimes.com/article/climate-change-global-warming-faq.html

9 - data cleaning:
- Remove content about reading in and setting column types directly - this can lead to NAs. Instead, show how as.numeric() and parse_number() are different, and state that re-typing things is generally better after reading everything in.

11 - polish:
- On color, add a slide about conventions: red (hot, bad), blue (cold), green (good)
- introduce font ninja Chrome plugin - just like eyedropper but for fonts
- Add wes anderson palette: https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson

12 - map:
- Add monsters on sf: https://github.com/r-spatial/sf
- Add "images/teamap.jpg" as an example of when a map is useful - the key
  relationship is inherently spatial: https://twitter.com/pwang/status/1387228573896003585

14 - shiny:
- Use a different example in the reading for this week that keeps the ui and server in the same file app.R

Reflections:
- Add the template "I used to think ______, now I think ______ ðŸ¤”" in there.

MP2:
- Introduce janitor::clean_names() here instead of rename()

Projects:
- Rename project pages to start with "project-" instead of "a-"
- Reduce weight of proposal, move it up earlier so more time to do preliminary work. Maybe even by 3 weeks earlier and move MP2 back.
- Revise team member "reviews" to be an "attribution" section just noting what each team member did on the project.
- Merge presentation in with final project report score.
Revise grading rubrics to look for effectiveness of design choices:
    - chart communicates key message
    - chart choice appropriate to show relationship / comparison
    - design elements are clear and not confusing
    - annotations are appropriate
