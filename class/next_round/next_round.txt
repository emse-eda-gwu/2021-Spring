General:
- Do a lecture on bias in data, e.g. "plane" image
- Drop datacamp from the class - didn't add much.
- Add at least one more redesign (maybe two).
- Add link for assignment 0 to getting started with data in R bootcamp site.
- Use memos for exercise assignments, and have the memos be .Rmd files that are compiled to different outputs (html, pdf, etc.) to practice compiling, publishing (including publishing a simple website to Github).
The memos should say three things they learned, and demonstrate one concept with actual data?
- Keep projects, but students must be in teams of 2-3 students (no more single person projects)
- Add Github to the course at the start for team collaboration.
- Look up 200306-SEAS-faculty notes for data examples
- Add new Horst monster images
- Move up cleaning data to earlier with dedicated data cleaning assignment / redesign.

Revise grading rubrics to look for effectiveness of design choices:
- chart communicates key message
- chart choice appropriate to show relationship / comparison
- design elements are clear and not confusing
- annotations are appropriate

Correlation:
- Add penguin_paradox.jpg

6-trends:
- Log scales - use them to show doubling rate? penny doubling example?
- Index chart (Financial times log chart of COVID cases - all start at days after 100 cases)

Projects:
- Merge presentation in with final project report score.
- Require publication of report to Github and video to youtube.
- Merge data sources and description into one criteria for final rubric about data.
- Reduce weight of research question for final rubric - just needs to be stated clearly.
