This week we will learn about how to make interactive web applications using the [R Shiny package](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Take a look at some examples of impressive apps built using Shiny:

- [Shiny COVID-19 tracker](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/covid19-tracker.html)
- [A Dashboard for Conference Tweets](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/conference-tweet-dashboard.html)
- [Medcare spending map](https://tychobra.shinyapps.io/medicare-map/)


View more examples at the [RStudio Showcase](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) and on [Tychobra.com](https://www.tychobra.com/shiny/).
